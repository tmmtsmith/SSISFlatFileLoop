SSIS
====

This is the SSIS project for looping through numerous flat files.  In the future, I'll add a link to an article on how to do this that I wrote.

**Note:**

Some code will now be private for followers only on a Google Drive.  To have access to this code, follow me on GitHub, send me an email with the subject of "Follow" with an email that also shows on your GitHub profile, and you'll be added to the private Google Drive repository.  When GitHub allows this feature to reward followers, this repository will move back to GitHub.  Thanks!
