SSIS

This is the SSIS project for looping through numerous flat files.  In the future, I'll add a link to an article on how to do this that I wrote.

**Note:**

Some code will now be private for followers on a Google Drive.  To have access to this code, follow me on GitHub with a an email address listed on your GitHub profile and that email will be added to the Drive's shared property.
